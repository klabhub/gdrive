# gdrive - a Matlab class to simplify interaction with Google Drive.

This Matlab class relies on Petter Rasmussen's gdrive tool for all of the actual interaction with 
Google Drive. See [https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive)

Example
```Matlab
g=gdrive; % Connect to Google Drive (specify credentials as requested)
g.makeDir('/Test') % Make a directory called Test on Google Drive
g.put('filename','/Test') % Put the local file called filename into the /Test directory on Google drive.
```
